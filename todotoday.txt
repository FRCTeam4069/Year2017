1. Check encoders on robot, make sure they are plugged in left-left right-right
1.5 Get autonomous straight/turn working at startup
2. Add limit switch to Turret to zero its encoder
3. get Turret code to use new limit switch and track encoder safety limit
4. Test shooter RPM code, make sure can change RPMs with buttons on controller
5. Try taking shot in autonomous


Get autonomous drive straight/turn working well.

See if we can get targeting to line up and take a shot afterwards
